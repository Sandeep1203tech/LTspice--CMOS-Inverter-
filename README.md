Why are we moving towards CMOS Technology?

CMOS Inverter has faster low-to-high and high-to-low output transitions compared to NMOS Inverter.Faster transitions are important -
1) Reduces signal propagation delays, which is particularly important in high-speed communication systems and digital circuits where delays can impact overall system performance.
2) Efficient transitions can help reduce power consumption.
3) Rapid transitions help in reducing the susceptibility to noise and interference, thereby improving the system's noise immunity and the accuracy of received data etc.

Power Dissipation in CMOS Inverter

![Power Dissipation in CMOS Inverter](https://github.com/Sandeep1203tech/LTspice--CMOS-Inverter-/assets/78650502/3cb53867-502f-4325-bdc3-2ddf8808516d)

The power dissipation in a CMOS inverter occurs when Vin = Vth and during the transition of VTC from logic high to logic low when both the transistors are operating in the saturation region.
